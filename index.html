        <h1 class="text-upper text-center">WELCOME TO THE GPCC 2016 YEAR IN REVIEW</h1>
        <h1 class="text-center">–</h1>
        <p>2016 was an exciting and successful year for the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, the advocacy arm of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. We advanced a number of priorities at the federal, state and local levels of government in support of the Conference’s agenda to <strong><em>Connect People to Opportunity</em></strong> and mission to improve the economy and quality of life in the 10-county Pittsburgh region. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>We achieved a big win in Washington, D.C. with the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN), which authorizes a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure investment to rehabilitate our waterways infrastructure as part of the Upper Ohio River Navigation project. At the state level, we made significant progress in advancing legislation to reform our public pension system and expand the Pennsylvania Neighborhood Assistance Program, a key part of the Allegheny Conference’s Strengthening Communities Partnership. And locally, we worked with the City of Pittsburgh and African American Chamber of Commerce of Western Pennsylvania to launch a program to help retain more of our local talent in the workforce.</p>
        <p>These are just a few of the highlights of the progress we made in 2016 by working alongside committed public and private sector partners. I encourage you to scroll down to learn more about our 2016 accomplishments, as well as our First Friday Speakers Series, three signature receptions and elected and public official roundtables. We look forward to working with you in 2017 and beyond to build off of this progress. And, as always, feel free to reach out to us to learn how you can get involved in advancing our region.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center">–</h1>
      <p>In 2016, Congress passed a multibillion-dollar infrastructure-funding package — the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN) — which will make critical investments to maintain and improve our nation’s ailing waterways infrastructure. The GPCC worked closely with partners, including the Port of Pittsburgh Commission and the Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition, to advance this key regional priority.</p>
      <p>The WIIN Act authorizes investments of $2.7 billion over 20 years on the Upper Ohio River to repair and maintain the Emsworth, Dashields and Montgomery locks and dams. The Upper Ohio River navigation project will ensure the reliable movement of goods that our region’s economy, including energy and manufacturing industries, depend upon. And the project will help stave off devastating effects to our recreational uses of the river, drinking water and water quality.</p>

      <p>Congress also passed the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which reforms the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). TSCA reform will help grow the chemical manufacturing industry, which employs more than 43,000 people in the Pittsburgh region. It will also assure consumers and producers that the chemicals in their goods are safe and risk-free.</p>
